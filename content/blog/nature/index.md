Since spring has arrived in Amsterdam the weather has been absolutely amazing. I wish there was a bit more rain for all the crops (sorry farmers), but with the sun out until late, it's a great opportunity to take a walk individually and appreciate the feeling of springtime. Why you may ask?

in the super connected, hyperactive modern world, we're always on edge waiting to respond for the next notification on our devices. For the people having trouble with distraction, please take a good long look at your smartphone and decide if it's maybe better to leave your phone in the drawer (or turn off the notification sound) especially if you're working on things that matter to you. 

Even more so taking a walk without being connected leaves you with your thoughts and you can process whatever is going on inside your amazing brain. After a busy day your brain is probably exploding with thoughts waiting to get your attention. An additional benefit is you will sometimes get new insights or idea's that you wouldn't have thought of if you didn't take this cooling down. 

If you're as fortunate as me and live nearby a park just take a stroll and appreciate the nature that is always there for you. If not you could take the bike and cycle to a nearby park or if you must take the car. (In the Netherlands we bike everywhere, literally :-) )

You may feel more save by taking your phone with you, but don't forget to activate `do not disturb mode` before you leave and try to resist the urge of checking your phone every minute. You could also temporarily switch it off. 

Believe me, as a former phone junky it will feel weird, it feels naked, like you're exposed by not brining your phone, but just try it out once and see if it works for you.
