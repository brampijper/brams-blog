## A Brief Reflection

This marks the return to the country where I was born: The Netherlands. After spending 2 years in Oslo, it was also time to leave the beautiful fjords behind me. I packed my bags and off I went to South-East Asia. I've explored being a digital nomad, spent time meditating with monks in the jungles of Thailand, and experienced martial arts training in the mountains of Eastern China. Nothing short of remarkable, I would say.

Looking back, each chapter of this journey offered its own lessons and challenges. Let me share a few of the most memorable experiences and what I took away from them.

## On Digital Nomading

One of the first adventures was embracing the digital nomad lifestyle. For a long time, I thought about travel and work, and thus this was a great opportunity to live like a digital nomad. In Chiang Mai, I spent time at a co-living space with around 20 other nomads. 

This was great because there were many fun events like yoga, ice bathing, networking events, and socializing. It's easier to find like-minded people, and the chances are high that you have common interests.

The insight I got from my time there was that at least 80% of the people were struggling with either generating enough income, finding a solid business idea, or dealing with personal struggles. 

> The lesson? Entrepreneurship is hard, especially while constantly moving and dealing with the stress of finding enough customers or a sustainable income.

Living as a digital nomad taught me that freedom comes with its own challenges and after the fast-paced and social environment of nomad life, I felt drawn to slow down and look inward.

## On Meditating

This led me to meditation. Meditation is great. Personally, I don't have to become a monk and enjoy life from the jungle, but it is an essential part of my routine. Whether it's a couple of minutes every day or longer stretches, it doesn't matter. 

Also, if meditation were easy, everyone would be doing it, right? It's a temporary relief from the self, from your thoughts and emotions, and that could be helpful.

My time meditating in Thailand taught me the importance of stillness amidst life’s impulses, and with that grounding experience, I felt ready to push my physical limits in a new setting.

## On Martial Arts Training

So I made my way to China, near Yantai—to embark on the next chapter of my journey. After all, we inhabit our bodies just as much as our minds, so why not ensure they’re as strong and healthy as possible as we move through life? 

The first week of training was tough: early mornings at 6:00, tai chi at dawn, and then diving into the main program, which included various fighting routines, sandboxing, qi-gong (standing meditation), and the occasional boot camp. But soon, the rhythm became familiar, and I found myself embracing the physical challenge.

What made this experience even more special was the setting. Being in China meant we could explore the countryside during our downtime, unwind at local hot springs, and savor authentic Chinese cuisine—hello dumplings, spicy noodles, and Chinese hamburgers.

After these mental and physical challenges, I found myself at a crossroads, wondering what I wanted next in life.

## Life's a Journey, So What's Next?

The urge for traveling is gone; more so than ever, I have the urge to settle down and build up a life near my friends and family. Having a steady job and income while continuing to work on my mind and body sounds like a pretty good deal to me. And of course, occasionally taking a holiday to hike in the Norwegian mountains—doesn’t sound so bad at all.

Maybe the next adventure isn’t in a far-off country, but in building something lasting right here. Who knows? I’m curious to see what comes next.
