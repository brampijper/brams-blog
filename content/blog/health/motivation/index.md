#### Just 5 minutes . . .
Getting motivated is sometimes a tricky businuess, but remember you will only achieve motivation once you start doing something.
That's why the 5 minute rule is important. Make your brain stop thinking and just start. Are you still not feeling the sense of motivation after 5 minutes? Then just stop and focus on something else. 

If you wait until you get motivated you're not in control of your own actions. It could take hours, days even weeks before you have the urge of motivation for that one thing you've been postponing.

As a personal example I've been reluctant to build this blog with Gatsby and React for several weeks now. It's always there in the back of my mind, but I keep letting myself get distracted with other (not-so) important stuff. By applying the 5 minutes rule I'm now succesfully writing my first blog post. 

Will this always work you may ask? Most definitely not, but even if you try applying the 5 minute rule and you fail 9 times but on the 10th try you succeed that's already a huge accomplishment isn't it?

I'll be writing more posts like these in the future. Any feedback is welcome :-)
