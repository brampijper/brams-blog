#### Love it, hate it!

My relationship with dopamine fits right into the "love it, hate it" category. Food cravings? Can't stop snacking? "Let me eat just one piece of chocolate" doesn't work for you? Well, I agree. Give me the whole damn chocolate bar! But why can't we be satisfied with just one piece of chocolate?

> Chocolate increases dopamine levels up to 200%!    

Well, it's easier for some people while others struggle more. Research indicates that there are major differences in the sensitivity of our nervous systems. The more sensitive it is, the likelihood of getting caught up in the relentless dopamine cycle increases.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter - a chemical released in our brain. It's the driving force behind our motivation to achieve goals and also regulates our emotional states, making us more resilient to change.

#### An example: The rollercoaster dopamine cycle

Have you ever experienced that surge of excitement when your brain anticipates a dopamine boost? Imagine reaching out to grab a piece of chocolate, already feeling in a better mood.

Interestingly, what happens after you've finished eating that piece of chocolate is crucial: Your brain releases less dopamine, meaning you'll feel worse than when you started. It's like a dip in happiness. ðŸ˜¢

Unfortunately, that drop in dopamine triggers the desire for more. Your brain wants to avoid feeling bad and craves that good mood again. It's a natural response, as humans simply seek pleasure and avoid discomfort.

So, what do you do next? Of course, you'll reach for another piece of chocolate. It's an attempt to chase that initial high and avoid feeling worse.

#### Escape the cycle 

And that's the relentless dopamine cycle in short. (This is only a basic understanding; there are, of course, more factors.) However, there are things you can do to break free from this cycle:


- Do a more **challenging activity** to recover faster
    - Physical exercises: pushups, pullups (or any exercise that is difficult for you).
    - Cold water exposure: to increase your baseline dopamine levels.
    - Solve a difficult math problem.
    - Learn a challenging language for a short amount of time.
- Use logic to counterbalance the dopamine dip: `I just ate food, I cannot be hungry right now.`
    - You may feel worse in the short term, but that's better than chasing another lower high and prolonging the dip eventually.

> Ever wonder why chocolate is always placed near the checkout registers in stores? 
> Now you know ;)

#### Important

This blog post only covers the basics of how dopamine works. I want to end this post by emphasizing the importance of:
- Enjoy the dopamine highs.
- Accept the feeling of a lowered mood after high dopamine activities.
- Understanding that sometimes you'll succeed, and other times you'll fail. That's completely okay. Don't be too hard on yourself!

Dopamine affects everyone, generally speaking, but it also depends on the dopamine pathways you've developed over the years. Discover your unique pathways by being more mindful and taking note when you're chasing the highs.
