#### Coming back 
 Learning how to program has taught me a great deal about myself, the world and others. The itch of life-long learning started itching again, so after a deep dive into my childhood, the many layers of my unconsciousness I bubbled back to the surface with fresh inspiration.

That inspiration means my vision for this blog has evolved: I want it to be more **authentic** and there will be blog posts that fit into 2 categories:
   1. **Technology**
   2. **Health**
Both are equally important for me. Without a good mental (health) state I enjoy life less and become stuck. On the other hand web development has taught me the joys of:
- Continuous learning,
- To become a problem fixer,
- To be able to use my creative energy in a new way: building my own idea's in the real world.

#### Authenticity
To be authentic is to be myself. Writing, developing & designing are tools that I use to express my creativity. In the past I have been struggling to express myself (and my work) online.

I was too scared and too sensitive of the judgemental opinions of others, which crushed my motivation. However over time this got better and the deepdive into my childhood trauma's resolved the major issues I had.

> Life is about balance anyway: happiness and pain are closely intertwined. Finding balance between them is the essential part of life.

I'll be writing more about the struggles and the tools I used to improve my life overall. At the same time i'll be working on a new front-end for this blog. 

#### Scrimba
I'm following this advanced React course on Scrimba to enhance my knowledge and leverage that knowledge to update this blog. In case you don't know [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/): It's one of my favourite tools, since its:
- Low cost
- A hands-on-approach teaching method.
- An active discord community with a bunch of friendly people.

Over the upcoming weeks I will be updating this blog with new features and new blog posts. Feel free to reach out for feedback, tips and other things :)

Cheers!
