After a year long break from coding to focus on my mental health and personal development I'm picking up web development again! Learning how to program has taught me a great deal about myself, the world and others. The itch of life long learning started itching again, so after a deep dive into my childhood, the many layers of my unconciousness I bubbled back to the surface stronger than ever. (I am actually slowly dying because I turned 30 this year. :D)

My vision for this blog has evolved: I want it to be **authentic** and there will be blog posts that fit into 2 categories:
   1. Web development & tech related posts
   2. Mental Health & Personal development
Both are equally important. Without a `good` mental state I enjoy life less and become stuck. Web development taught me the joys of continious learning, to become a problem fixer and to be able to use my creative energy in a new way: building my own idea's in the real world.

To be authentic is to be myself. Writing and building websites is a way for me to express my creativity. To be out there in the world where people can see my work. Unfortunately we live in a judgemental world and that has been crushing my motivation in the past, however that part has been resolved: I have gained my self confidence and I have an optimistic world view.

Of course I will still struggle and have bad moments: those are part of life. Life is about balance anyways: you can't feel happy without pain.

My first goal is to get back into learning React and write about my progress. Scrimba is my platform of choice since it's low cost, a hands-on-approach and easily accessible through the browser. Scrimba also has an active discord community with a bunch of friendly people. :) (this is not a paid endorsment btw.)

Over the upcoming weeks I will be updating this blog with new features and new blog posts. I'll try to find a rythym that works for me and If you have feedback, questions or requests feel free to reach out.

Cheers!
